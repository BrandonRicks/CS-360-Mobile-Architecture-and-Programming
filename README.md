# CS 360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
Per the requriements, this app is an event tracker, and is designed to allow for user login functionality, as well as CRUD functionality for data stored within the SQLite databases for both users information, and event information. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app allows for user registration, login, and a forgot password option. The primary function of the app is an event tracker, which allows a user to add, edit, and delete data, as well as an SMS permissions request that allows the user to receive SMS messages about upcoming events. The forgot password and edit of events both are popup features.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I used coding best practices, simplified code structure to keep it legible and clean, and commenting to explain portions of code.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing, especially regarding UI design and structure, was done from a phone, and adjusted in real time. With this method, I could use a physical phone, similarly to a user, and make small UI adjustments, and code adjustments, in order to create a better user experience, and a more visually appealing app.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In designing the UI of the app, I had to make various changes to the design, in order to create something that I felt was more in line with the requirements and goals of the project. My initial design evolved as I better grasped the material, and the process of developing an app.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The login functionality, as well as its ability to make use of stored user data within the SQLite database, was a success in my eyes. It allows for multiple users, properly stored user data that can be logged back into, cannot be duplicated, and allows for a user to retrieve a password with more than one requesting form of information. This creates a semblance of security, but also a more feature rich part of the app.
